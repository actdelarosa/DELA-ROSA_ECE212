The language that you are programming in (e.g., Python). \n   * C. The environment/tool in which you are programming. \n   * D. the number (or “code”) that you must input at the top of each program to tell the computer how to execute your program.\n> **Ans --> A**\n3. What is the difference between a high-level programming language and a lowlevel programming language? \n   * A. It is high-level if you are standing and low-level if you are sitting.\n   * B. It is high-level if you are programming for a computer and low-level if you are programming for a phone or mobile device.\n   * C. It is high-level if the program must be processed before it can run, and lowlevel if the computer can execute it without additional processing.\n   * D. It is high-level if it easy to program in and is very short; it is low-level if it is really hard to program in and the programs are really long.\n> **Ans --> C**\n4. Pick the best replacements for 1 and 2 in the following sentence: When comparing compilers and interpreters, a compiler is like 1 while an interpreter is like 2. \n   * A. 1 = a process, 2 = a function \n   * B. 1 = translating an entire book, 2 = translating a line at a time \n   * C. 1 = software, 2 = hardware \n   * D. 1 = object code, 2 = byte code \n> **Ans --> B**\n5.

The same thing as an algorithm. \n> **Ans --> A**\n8. The differences between natural and formal languages include: \n   * A. Natural languages can be parsed while formal languages cannot. \n   * B. Ambiguity, redundancy, and literalness. \n   * C. There are no differences between natural and formal languages. \n   * D. Tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics.\n> **Ans --> B**\n9.
