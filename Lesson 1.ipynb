At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and objectives that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.\n\nUnderstanding computer programs requires algorithmic, mechanistic thinking. Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed, they transform input data into output data. They execute very reliably, and very fast, but not creatively. Computers do what you tell them to do, not what you mean for them to do. Thus, understanding computer code involves a lot of mental simulation of what will actually happen, not what you wish would happen.\n\nWriting computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills.\n***"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Activity\n1. **Why do you think understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today especially in the new normal?** \n   >Learning computer programming is an essential skill because in this new age so much of our world is automated.

They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.\n\n**Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols.\n\n*__Programming languages__ are **formal languages** that have been designed to express computations.*\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Key Difference between Natural and Formal Language**\n1. **Ambiguity** - Natural languages are full of ambiguity; which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n2. **Redundancy** - In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n3. **Literalness** \n  * Formal languages mean exactly what they say. On the other hand, natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If someone says, “The other shoe fell”, there is probably no shoe and nothing falling.\n  * People who grow up speaking a natural language—that is, everyone— often have a hard time adjusting to formal languages. In some ways, the difference between natural and formal language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:\n4. **Poetry** - Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.\n5. **Prose** - The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\n6. **Program** - The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.\n\n---"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.4 A Typical First Program\n\nTraditionally, the first program written in a new language is called **Hello, World!** because all it does is display the words, Hello, World!.
